# Capstone Project 1

This program was created to fulfill the requirements of my first capstone project at Purwadhika (Data science & machine learning course).
The program contains a rental car application that has Create, Read, Update, and Delete features as the primary requirement of the project,
and a 'search by car transmission' as the additional feature. There are 7 options on the main menu that users can choose:  

1. "Cek Stok Mobil"     : Shows the availability of all the cars. (Read Feature)
2. "Tambah Stok Mobil"  : Adding a new car to the stock. (Add Feature) 
3. "Delete Stok"        : Delete an existing car from the stock. (Delete Feature)
4. "Search by Transmision" : Some users are only intrested in the specific transmission type. This option allows users to search for cars by the transmission types (AT/MT) (Search Feature)
5. "Pemesanan"          : Order a car. The car will move to another dictionary dedicated to cars that are being rented and provide the renter's name. (Update Feature)
6. "Pengembalian"       : Return a rented car.
7. "Selesai"            : Closes the program.
